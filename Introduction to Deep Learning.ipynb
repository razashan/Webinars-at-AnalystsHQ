    "Deep learning is the branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data."

    "* <b>Input Layer:</b> The input layer is the starting point of a neural network. It receives the input data, which could be features from a dataset or raw input such as images or text.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* <b>Hidden Layers:</b> Hidden layers are the intermediate layers between the input and output layers. They perform computations and apply activation functions to transform the input data. Neural networks can have one or more hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each layer can vary.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* <b>Neurons:</b> Neurons are the basic processing units of a neural network. Each neuron receives inputs, applies a transformation (weighted sum of inputs plus a bias term), and passes the result through an activation function. The activation function introduces non-linearity and enables the neural network to learn complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* <b>Weights and Biases:</b> Each connection between neurons in different layers has an associated weight, which determines the strength or importance of that connection. The weights are adjusted during the training process to optimize the network's performance. Biases are additional parameters that allow neurons to fire even when inputs are zero.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* <b>Activation Functions:</b> Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network. Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function, and rectified linear unit (ReLU). They help the network learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* <b>Output Layer:</b> The output layer is the final layer of a neural network. It produces the network's predictions or outputs based on the transformed information from the hidden layers. The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the type of problem the neural network is designed to solve. For example, a binary classification task would have one neuron in the output layer, while a multi-class classification task would have multiple neurons.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* <b>Loss Function:</b> The loss function measures the difference between the predicted outputs of the neural network and the actual expected outputs. It quantifies the network's performance during training and helps guide the optimization process. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), categorical cross-entropy, and binary cross-entropy.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* <b>Optimization Algorithm:</b> The optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, is responsible for updating the weights and biases of the neural network based on the computed loss. It iteratively adjusts the network's parameters to minimize the loss function and improve its predictive performance.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* <b>Backpropagation:</b> Backpropagation is the key algorithm used to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the network. It propagates the error from the output layer back through the hidden layers, allowing for efficient parameter updates during training."
